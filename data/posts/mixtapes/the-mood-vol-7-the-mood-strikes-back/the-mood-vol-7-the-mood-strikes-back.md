I'm writing today to announce a major breakthrough in my patented mixtape technology, _The Mood®_. Previously shown to be up to 98%\* effective against common symptoms of heartache, _The Mood®_ is back, with a completely new format.

Once a month, I will compile a mixtape of the music I've been into, along with any articles, videos, or otherwise interesting stuff I come across in my day-to-day adventures, and send it to you via email. Consider it a way for us to stay in touch – a compilation of everything I think you'll enjoy, and an opportunity for you to share stuff you think I'll enjoy, too.

In the meantime, if you're ever in the mood to groove: check out the Soul Provider [live stream](https://soulprovidr.fm) for a non-stop selection of my favourite tracks. I update the playlist every weekend, so feel free to send me suggestions of songs you'd like to see on rotation.

Please enjoy the very first edition of the new-and-improved _The Mood®_.
