## Be direct

Imagine this scenario: you're a lifelong people-pleaser, and suddenly you are responsible for conducting performance reviews of colleagues you've worked with for the past five years, several of whom are older and more experienced than you.

That was the situation I faced when I assumed the role of Tech Lead.

As you can imagine, this was a difficult situation to navigate. Delivering criticism or bad news was completely against my nature. Delivering criticism or bad news in a professional context to people I consider my friends was even worse. This is probably the aspect of the role that gave me the most anxiety, and, as such, probably the single most important obstacle I had to overcome in order to become an effective leader.

Without direct communication, you leave things up to chance. The more clear you can be regarding requirements, processes, and feedback, the more certainty you introduce into your working environment. As I realized, as long as you have the best interests of your team members in mind, most people appreciate honesty even if it might sting at first.

Speaking personally, knowing how I am perceived or what I can do improve upon is highly preferable to NOT knowing – so, with that in mind, I try to be as open and honest with my team as possible.

## Start with the constants

If you become a Tech Lead in a young, growing software company (as I did), you are probably going to be facing a deal of uncertainty as you continue to scale your product and your team. An endless series of decisions to make about everything from hiring to processes to system architecture coupled with an unclear set of responsibilities can make it difficult to know exactly what you should be doing, and when.

The mistake I made at first was that I focused on this uncertainty – the things that I didn't know. However, this was the totally wrong approach. The smart thing to do when faced with uncertainty is to focus on the things you _do_ know, and make sure you are taking care of those items before venturing too far out into the unknown.

For me, this was stuff like scheduling recurring monthly 1-on-1s with my team, conducting bi-annual performance reviews, completing code reviews in a timely manner, running sprints, releasing our changes on a regular cadence, etc. – the basics (read: minimum requirements) of the role.

Getting to grips with these fundamental responsibilities was an important milestone for me. I then had a solid foundation upon which I could explore some of the unknowns with a little more confidence.

## Delegate more than you think you should

Alternatively, for the developers in the back: **write less code than you think you should**.

As the original author and maintainer of the application my team works on, I am in a good position to add high value functionality, or fix a critical issue when something goes wrong. At first, when I was one of three developers on the team, I took ownership of these items myself – but as the team and platform grew it wasn't long before I saw myself become a bottleneck.

The obvious solution to this was: delegate more. But it was hard to let go. Eventually, though, I realized that by taking on these items I was actually doing my team members a disservice: I was denying them the opportunity to grow by giving them the responsibility to solve interesting problems.

I had to trust my team members and empower them with the information necessary to make informed decisions not just to get things done faster overall, but also to create a more resilient team. Knowledge is now spread more evenly across the group. Our [bus factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor) is higher. Letting go, although difficult, was one the best decisions I made.

## Set healthy boundaries

There is a trend I have noticed in myself and other naïve, first-time tech leads: the tendency to work unsustainable hours.

This is especially bad in teams spanning multiple timezones or competing in international markets – since the end of your workday might line up nicely with the beginning of your co-worker's, or an international partner might run into an issue at 1am EST – but even just trying to balance your coding priorities with your daily management responsibilities can be a challenge.

The problem is, you can only operate like this for so long before burning out. Although I told myself I was making a short-term sacrifice for long-term gain, and thought I could take measures to avoid (or at least mitigate) burnout, I was totally unprepared for the force with which it hit me when it eventually did.

Recognizing one's own limitations can be humbling. I had this idea that the team needed me online at all hours to keep things ticking, but maybe that wasn't the case, after all. I set up an experiment where I stopped working after work for a week to see what would happen.

There was no change at all, except I was much less tired and had time to pursue some things I enjoyed after work, which led to me feeling happier overall. This was all the evidence I needed – I made it a point from then on to sign off at the end of the day (and stayed signed off).
