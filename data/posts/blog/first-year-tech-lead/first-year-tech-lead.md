## Be direct

## Start with the constants

## Embrace uncertainty

## Delegate more than you think you should

Alternatively, for the developers in the back: **write less code than you think you should**.

As the original author and maintainer of the application my team works on, I am in a good position to add high value functionality, or fix a critical issue when something goes wrong. At first, when I was one of three developers on the team, I took ownership of these items myself – but as the team and platform grew it wasn't long before I saw myself become a bottleneck.

The obvious solution to this was: delegate more. But it was hard to let go. Eventually, though, I realized that by taking on these items I was actually doing my team members a disservice: I was denying them the opportunity to grow by giving them the responsibility to solve an interesting problem.

By trusting my team members and empowering them with the information necessary to make informed decisions, not only do things now get done faster overall, but our team is much more resilient. Knowledge is spread more evenly across the group. Our [bus factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor) is higher. Letting go was one the best decisions I could have made.

## Set healthy boundaries

There is a trend I have noticed in myself and other naïve, baby-faced, first-time tech leads: the tendency to work unsustainable hours.

This is especially bad in teams spanning multiple timezones or competing in international markets – since the end of your workday might line up nicely with the beginning of your co-worker's, or an international partner might run into an issue at 1am EST – but even just trying to balance your coding priorities with your daily management responsibilities can be a challenge for the inexperienced tech lead.

The problem is, you can only operate like this for so long before burning out. As I found out the hard way: you can't be everything to everyone. Although I told myself I was making a short-term sacrifice for long-term gain, and thought I could take measures to avoid (or at least mitigate) burnout, I was totally unprepared for the force with which it hit me when it eventually did.

Recognizing one's own limitations can be humbling, but necessary. I had this idea that the team needed me online at all hours to keep things ticking, but maybe that wasn't the case, after all. I set up an experiment where I stopped working after work for a week to see what would happen.

The answer is: well...nothing. There was no change at all, except I was much less tired and had time to pursue some things I enjoyed after work, which led to me feeling happier overall. After I had demonstrated to myself that my premise was totally wrong, it was much easier to sign off (and stay signed off) at the end of the day moving forward.
