## Start with the constants

For me, being thrust into management after being a developer for 5 years was somewhat overwhelming. The time that I had previously associated with quiet reflection and focus now became interrupted by an endless stream of meetings, messages, and code reviews. With so many competing concerns, it suddenly became difficult for me to prioritize my new, seemingly endless list of responsibilities effectively.

The outcome of this situation was something that resembled a state of paralysis. Although I was expending a ton of energy fielding all of the requests that were coming my way, it felt like I wasn't making meaningful progress in any given direction.

In the meantime, if you're ever in the mood to groove: check out the Soul Provider [live stream](https://soulprovidr.fm) for a non-stop selection of my favourite tracks. I update the playlist every weekend, so feel free to send me suggestions of songs you'd like to see on rotation.

## Delegate more than you think you should

Re-stated for the developers in the back: **write less code than you think you should**.

Once a month, I will compile a mixtape of the music I've been into, along with any articles, videos, or otherwise interesting stuff I come across in my day-to-day adventures, and send it to you via email. Consider it a way for us to stay in touch – a compilation of everything I think you'll enjoy, and an opportunity for you to share stuff you think I'll enjoy, too.
